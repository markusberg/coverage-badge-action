This action lets you generate a code coverage badge to your GitHub-pages, for easy serving from your project README.md.

## Fork information

This is a fork of [we-cli/coverage-badge-action](https://github.com/we-cli/coverage-badge-action), with added features, and updated dependencies. But mostly it's for me to learn about GitHub actions.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have gh-pages branch and have GitHub Pages on:

   ```sh
   # if you don't have gh-pages yet, create an empty one
   git stash save my_wip_state  # if not clean (1)
   git switch --orphan gh-pages
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
   git push -u origin gh-pages

   git checkout my_original_branch
   git stash apply stash^{/my_wip_state}  # if not clean (2)
   ```

   See Step.6 in [ðŸš€ Blog Setup via Github Fork](https://fritx.github.io/silent/?2022/09/blog-setup-via-github-fork)

   > 6\. (Important) Select both gh-pages and / (root) in Project Settings -> Pages

1. Give workflow permission:

   On your repository `Settings -> Action -> General -> Workflow permissions` choose `Read and Write permissions`

1. Whatever the coverage tool is, don't forget to have `reporter=json-summary` enabled:

   ```diff
   // package.json
   -  "test:cov": "c8 xv",
   +  "test:cov": "c8 -r text -r json-summary xv",
   // or
   -  "coverage": "nyc mocha",
   +  "coverage": "nyc -r text -r json-summary mocha",
   ```

1. Add the action to your current workflow

   ```yml
   # .github/workflows/test.yml
   name: Test
   on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         # Your original steps
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
         - name: Install
           run: npm install
         - name: Test and Coverage
           run: npm run test:cov # or npm run coverage

         # Add this
         - name: Update Coverage Badge
           # GitHub actions: default branch variable
           # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64781462/github-actions-default-branch-variable
           if: github.ref == format('refs/heads/{0}', github.event.repository.default_branch)
           uses: markusberg/coverage-badge-action@main
   ```

1. Add the badge to your README.md

   ```diff
   <!-- README.md -->
   + [![cov](https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/<you>/<repo>/actions)
   ```

   Replace the `<you>` and `<repo>` above, like:

   ```diff
   <!-- README.md -->
   + [![cov](https://markusberg.github.io/unixcrypt/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/markusberg/unixcrypt/actions)
   ```

   and you get:

   [![cov](https://markusberg.github.io/unixcrypt/badges/coverage.svg)](https://github.com/we-cli/unixcrypt/actions)
